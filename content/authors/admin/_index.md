I am a second-year master student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China. I am supervised by [Prof. Yan Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~eecyan/) and my research interest is about computer vision and computational imaging, especially on Non-line-of-sight(NLOS) imaging.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree at UESTC in 2019.
